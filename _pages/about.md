Bioinformatician by training, with 10 years of experience implementing FAIR data principles through semantic modeling and standards adoption to maximize the use of data across research domains. I have applied my skills in Systems Biology, Molecular Biology, and now in Healthcare, ensuring that infrastructures are designed to enable stakeholders to make their datasets findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.

Since 2020, my expertise has expanded to Semantic Web technologies, RDF modeling, and linked data, supporting the construction of FAIR-compliant knowledge graphs and cross-domain data connectivity, using standard terminologies and vocabularies. 

Passionate about transforming complex datasets into actionable insights, I enjoy supporting teams through in-person training, implementation of tools and application of existing standards to help them leverage data, accelerate research, and drive impactful scientific outcomes.

Currently, I am working at SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics as a Scientific Coordinator for the exciting and challenging [Swiss Personalized Health Network](https://sphn.ch/) (SPHN) project.

In my spare time, I enjoy wildlife photography, strategic board games and needlework.
